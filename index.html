        <p class="subtitle">As promised, this is a completely different page.</p>
        <p>Look at the URL path - it changed.</p>
        <p>But this page loaded instantly. If you observe the network tab in DevTools, no network requests have been made.</p>
        <p>And if you observe the DOM, only this <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag has changed.</p>
        <p>How does this work? <a data-router data-route="page_2" href="/page_2">Click here</a> to go to <code>/page_2</code> and find out.</p>

        <p class="subtitle">All the routing logic has been implemented client-side in JavaScript.</p>
        <p>We've actually never left the root <code>index.html</code> page - check the source.</p>
        <p>This behavior is the eponymous characteristic of an <dfn><abbr title="Single Page Application">SPA</abbr></dfn>.</p>
        <p><a data-router data-route="page_3" href="/page_3">Click here</a> to go to <code>/page_3</code> and learn more.</p>

        <p class="subtitle">There are a few important behaviors that are often overlooked when implementing client-side routing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The backward and forward buttons need to work as expected.</li>
          <li>Direct links to specific pages need to work.</li>
          <li>Middle click, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd</kbd> click, <kbd>Shift</kbd> click, and "right click > open link in new tab" all need to work on links and link-like buttons as expected.</li>
          <li>Invalid routes need to return <code>HTTP 404</code> errors (this behavior is critical for <dfn><abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr></dfn>).</li>
          <li>When hovering links and link-like buttons, the web browser's native status bar (typically shown at the bottom-left of the window) needs to show the destination address.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to isolate the problem of client-side routing and provide a minimal reference implementation for it.</p>
        <p>All the behaviors above have been implemented for this website in about 50 total lines of JavaScript.</p>
